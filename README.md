Diabetes-Prediction-System
An interactive machine learning-powered web app to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical parameters. Built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit â€” this project blends AI with simplicity and impact.

 ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project uses a trained ML classification model to detect diabetes based on user input such as glucose level, insulin, BMI, age, and more. The model was built using *Scikit-learn, data processed using NumPy and Pandas, and the UI is developed using Streamlit to offer a smooth and instant prediction experience.

The model was serialized using Pickle, allowing real-time prediction without retraining. The app is responsive, lightweight, and requires no technical background to use â€” just input your data and click Predict.
